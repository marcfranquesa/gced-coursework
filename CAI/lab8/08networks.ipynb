    "\n",
    "In class you have seen three main random network models:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Erdös-Rényii model (ER model).**\n",
    "The ER model takes two parameters:\n",
    "$n$, the number of vertices in the resulting network, and\n",
    "$p$, the probability of having an edge between any two pairs of nodes.\n",
    "A graph following this model is generated by connecting pairs of vertices with probability $p$, independently for each pair of vertices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Watts-Strogatz model (WS model).**\n",
    "The WS model takes two parameters as well:\n",
    "$n$, the number of vertices in the resulting network, and\n",
    "$p$, the probability of rewiring the edges in the initial network.\n",
    "A graph following this model is generated by initially laying all nodes out in a circle, and connecting each node to its four closest nodes. After that, we randomly reconnect each edge with probability $p$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Barabasi-Albert model (BA model).**\n",
    "The BA model takes two parameters:\n",
    "$n$, the number of vertices in the resulting network, and\n",
    "$m$, the number of edges a _new_ vertex brings to attach itself to existing nodes.\n",
    "A graph in this model is generated by adding new nodes according to the _preferential attachment principle_ until the\n",
    "resulting graph has the desired size.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to generate the following plots using `igraph`: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Plot the clustering coefficient and the average shortest-path as a function of the parameter $p$ of the WS model.\n",
    "2. Plot the average shortest-path length as a function of the network size of the ER model.\n",
    "3. Plot a histogram of the degree distribution of a BA network. What distribution does this follow? Can you describe it?\n",
    "\n",
    "For option (1), notice that in order to include both values - average shortest path and clustering coefficient - in the same figure, the clustering coefficient and the average shortest-path values are scaled to be within the range $[0,1]$. This is achieved by dividing the values by the value obtained at the left-most point, that is, when $p=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For option (2), you will have to experiment with appropriate values of $p$ which may depend on the parameter $n$. You will notice that for large values of $n$ your code may take too long, compute values for $n$ that are reasonable for you. Also, make sure that you chose values for $p$ that result (with high probability) in connected graphs. To achieve this, you can use a result from [this famous paper](https://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/erdos60random.pdf) stating (in the following, think of $\\epsilon$ as a small positive real number):\n",
    "\n",
    "- If $p < \\frac{(1-\\epsilon)\\ln n}{n}$ then a graph in $G(n, p)$ will almost surely contain isolated vertices, and thus be disconnected\n",
    "- If $p > \\frac{(1+\\epsilon)\\ln n}{n}$ then a graph in $G(n, p)$ will almost surely be connected\n",
    "\n",
    "For option (3), choose a network that is large enough so that results are what is expected from this model."
