    "## 1. The SI epidemic model\n",
    "\n",
    "In classic epidemiology, it is assumed that every individual has an equal chance of coming into contact with every other individual in the population.\n",
    "This is, however, highly unrealistic and we can improve on this assumption by simulating the spread of an infection over a realistic contact social network.\n",
    "In such a network, nodes are individuals susceptible to becoming sick and edges correspond to their chance of making physical contact and thus getting infected.\n",
    "\n",
    "The SI model is one of the most simple models used for studying infection and assumes that individuals can be in one of two states: _infected_, or _susceptible_ to infection (i.e. not infected yet). \n",
    "Initially, all individuals (or nodes) are susceptible and at time $t=0$ some node becomes infected (this node corresponds to _patient 0_). \n",
    "Over time, as nodes come into contact with other nodes, they may become infected too and can spread the disease further to their contacts and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "An important parameter of this model is the _infection rate_ $\\alpha$ which is the probability that an infected node infects a neighbouring one after contact. \n",
    "Clearly, $0\\leq\\alpha\\leq 1$ and the closer it is to 1 the faster the infection will spread. Additionally, the underlying topology of the contact network also \n",
    "plays a role in how the infection spreads and this is what you have to study in this session.\n"

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "## 2. Simulating the SI epidemic model at discrete time steps\n",
    "\n",
    "You will have to implement the simulation of the spreading of the SI model over diverse network topologies using discrete time steps. Thus, given a contact network $G$, we have that:\n",
    "\n",
    "- at time $t = 0$ a random node becomes infected\n",
    "- after each time step (that is, one infection round), each infected node potentially infects neighboring nodes independently with probability $\\alpha$\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use the `igraph` library from last session to help you with the generation of contact networks, managing of nodes' statuses, etc. \n",
    "Also, we will be using undirected graphs as contact networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The quantity of interest to monitor will be the fraction of infected nodes over time, which should grow over time since infected nodes never recover in this model.\n",
    "\n",
    ">   _You should be careful when implementing your simulation; please make sure that the updates of the nodes’ statuses are done in parallel, that is, to update the status for time t only statuses of time t−1 of the other nodes are considered._\n"

    "This is going to be highly useful for the implementation of the epidemic simulation. \n",
