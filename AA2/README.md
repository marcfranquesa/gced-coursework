Fall semester of 2023/2024. Here is a list of labs included as well as a brief description. The notebooks rely heavily on the python library _PyTorch_.

* [Lab 1](/AA2/lab01): intro to _tensors_
* [Lab 2](/AA2/lab02): intro to _backpropagation_
* [Lab 3](/AA2/lab03): intro to _loss functions_, _optimizers_ & _learning rate schedulers_
* [Lab 4](/AA2/lab04): creating a simple MLP to classify the _MNIST_ dataset
* [Lab 5](/AA2/lab05): creating a CNN to classify the _MNIST_ dataset
* [Lab 6](/AA2/lab06): techinques to interpret what a _CNN_ is doing
* [Lab 7](/AA2/lab07): playing around with imagenet
* [Lab 8](/AA2/lab08): fighting overfitting
* [Lab 9](/AA2/lab09): transfer learning & image classification
* [Lab 10](/AA2/lab10): rnns & seq2seq
