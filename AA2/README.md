# [AA2: Machine Learning 2](https://www.fib.upc.edu/en/studies/bachelors-degrees/bachelor-degree-data-science-and-engineering/curriculum/syllabus/AA2-GCED)
Fall semester of 2023/2024. Here is a list of labs included as well as a brief description. The notebooks rely heavily on the python library _PyTorch_.

* [Lab 1](/AA2/lab1): intro to _tensors_.
* [Lab 2](/AA2/lab2): intro to _backpropagation_.
* [Lab 3](/AA2/lab3): intro to _loss functions_, _optimizers_ & _learning rate schedulers_.
* [Lab 4](/AA2/lab4): creating a simple MLP to classify the _MNIST_ dataset.
* [Lab 5](/AA2/lab5): creating a CNN to classify the _MNIST_ dataset.
* [Lab 6](/AA2/lab6): techinques to interpret what a _CNN_ is doing.
